        <p class="lead">Graduated from UWTSD with a degree in Web Development in July 2018.</p>

          and see what different assignments I have worked on.

      <div class="row marketing">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4><a href="https://github.com/xleahcahill/TypeScript">TypeScript and AJAX</a></h4><br>
          <p> A single page application that uses HTTP methods; POST, GET, DELETE
            and PUT to manipulate data input by the user.
          </p>

          <h4><a href="https://github.com/xleahcahill/ASPAssignment">ASP.NET assignment</a><br></h4>
          <p>A web application that focuses on selling concert tickets, which enables the user
            to select from a range of tickets and prices and calcuates the total. Written in ASP.net.
          </p>

        <h4><a href="https://github.com/xleahcahill/UsabilityProject">Usability in Mobile Applications</a></h4>
          <p>This project focused on usability within mobile applications. A handful of users were asked
            to evaluate an existing mobile application from the app store. Using this feedback and using
            the System Usability Scale to measure usability, an interface of
            a hybrid mobile application was created using the Ionic 2 framework. This application was loaded 
            onto a Samsung tablet and evaluated by the same people. The results were compared and discussed.
          </p>

                  <h4><a href="https://github.com/xleahcahill/WCF">Exploring WCF Concepts</a></h4>
          <p>This assignment focused on the ABCS of WCF (Address, Binding, Contract). 
            The application was created with a peer-to-peer exchange pattern set as the binding and the interface of the e-commerce
            system is a basic windows form application. The application
            includes other concepts such as encryption, decryption, connecting to a 
            database to store users data and threading/Delegates in C#. 
            
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4><a href="https://github.com/xleahcahill/PHPSQL"> PHP OOP and SQL </a><br><br></h4>
          <p>Manipulating data in a database by using OOP to structure the
       PHP code and SQL to perform the DROP, DELETE, INSERT and SELECT operations.<br></p><br></p>

          <h4><a href="https://github.com/xleahcahill/PHPMVC"> Exploring PHP Concepts </a></h4>
          <p>A module where I explored concepts such as design patterns within PHP, especially the
            MVC pattern. The file includes a basic MVC pattern code file and a more complex one. 
            Other PHP concepts were explored such as creating a simple REST API in PHP which are included within this link.
          </p>

          <h4><a href="https://github.com/xleahcahill/UXprototype">User Experience ProtoType</a></h4>
          <p>This project focused on UX. The initial stages of the project included researching different 
            ways to measure user experience and usability and resulted in the first set of wireframes of an app
            that helped users learn about a new university campus.
          The second stage resulted in coloured storyboards of the app and slight changes from the
          feedback on the first set of wireframes.
           This final part of the
        assignment is a prototype where users were given walkthroughs and tasks to complete
      in order to test the usability, more changes and discussions of future improvements
      were concluded in the third stage based upon updated feedback. The prototype was created using
    the Ionic 2 framework. </p>
